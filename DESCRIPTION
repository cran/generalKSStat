Description: Computing KS-like goodness-of-fit test statistics such as the 
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Berk-Jones and the higher criticism statistics. 
    The p-values are computed via the Exact-KS-FFT(fast Fourier transform) method 
    developed by Dimitrova, Kaishev, Tan (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v039.i11>. 
    The algorithm works for the sample size up to 25,000.
